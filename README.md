# In-shoe-pressure-foot-contact-event-detection
A set of 7 pressure based foot contact event detection algorithms that can be used to detect foot contact events in running.

JAN 2023
Code written by Samuel Blades and Hunter Marriott

The algorithms are written to detect foot contact events using in-shoe plantar pressure data. The algorithms are designed to run post-hoc on the sum of the plantar pressure data, normalized between 0 - 100 of signal max. 

For more information on the validation and testing of these algorithms please see the following publication:
